## Evaluation Labs for Networked Software for Distributed Systems (M.Sc. Computer Science and Engineering) - Politecnico di Milano (PoliMi)

This is the collection of codes developed for the evaluation labs of the Networked Software for Distributed Systems course at Politecnico di Milano.

Evaluated positively: 30/30

### Course Syllabus

The course presents key technologies for the design and implementation of large scale network applications and complex distributed systems, including scenarios of high-performance computing, big-data analytics, event-driven architectures, Internet of Things, edge computing, and mobile robotics. The course favors a practical approach: the explanation of concepts and abstractions is tightly linked to their practical application, using the the most appropriate technology at hand for the considered scenario. In specific cases, dedicated hardware for experimentation will be provided by the lecturer, including for instance rapid prototyping kits for the Internet of Things, smart home devices, and mobile robots. These will be complemented by providing students with remote access to a real preconfigured home automation scenario available for the course. Verification of the learning outcomes is accomplished by the students throughout the course by means of dedicated lab sessions, or based on the design and implementation of a software artifact at the end of the course.
