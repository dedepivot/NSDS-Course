PROCESS SCHEDULING (CASE SENSITIVE):
•PROCESS_PAUSE():releases control, rescheduled immediately
•PROCESS_YIELD():releases control, wait for next event
•process_poll(&process_name): polls another protothread
•PROCESS_EXIT(): stops a protothread
•process_exit(&process_name): kills another protothread

TIMER
**Generate events for protothreads:**
•etimer: generates events when timers expire
•stimer: like etimer for longer periods

**Execute callbacks:**
•ctimer: schedule function executions in time
•rtimer: preempts currently running functions with callback execution (provides predictable timer semantics)
